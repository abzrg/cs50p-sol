## Object Oriented Programming

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming
paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code:
data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code,
in the form of procedures (often known as methods). -- Wikipedia

### Programming paradigms
- Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on
  their features.  Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.

### Common programming paradigms include:
- imperative in which the programmer instructs the
machine how to change its state,
  - _procedural_ which groups instructions into procedures,
  - _object-oriented_ which groups instructions with the part of the state they
  operate on,
- declarative in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired
result, but not how to compute it
  - _functional_ in which the desired result is declared as the value of
  a series of function applications,
  - _logic_ in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question
  about a system of facts and rules,
  - _mathematical_ in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an
  optimization problem
  - _reactive_ in which the desired result is declared with data streams and the
  propagation of change
